# The DGHD Quarantine Sheriff!
Leave everything to the big man sheriff. Mo mo knows how to protect and how to serve, and have a li'l fun in between.

## Commands
The sheriff can respond to the following commands below.

### arrest
```
!arrest @<offending user>
```
The sheriff will "arrest" the mentioned user and proceed to ask what crime they have committed (see mentions below). If an answer isn't given within 60 seconds, the sheriff will let the user go free. Only one accusation can be active at a time.

### commands
```
!commands
```
The sheriff will list out all available commands.

### currentsuspect
```
!currentsuspect
```
If the sheriff has someone currently under suspicion, the sheriff will mention the user and who accused them of a crime.

### meow
```
!meow
```
One may attempt to command the sheriff as a cat. Whether or not he will know how - or want - to respond remains to be seen.

### offenses
```
!offenses
```
The sheriff will list all offenses of which a user can be accused, along with the sentences they carry.

### rolld
```
!rolld<positive integer>
```
The sheriff will manifest and roll a dice comprising of the given sides and state the outcome of the roll. A "d2" will result in the flipping of a coin.

### whosinjail
```
!whosinjail
```
The sheriff will list all users currently in jail and the offense for which they are incarcerated.

## Direct Mentions
If one directly mentions the sheriff and includes a statement the sheriff understands, a variety of behaviors will take place. The follwing sentences, and their subsets ("can I have a beer" works as well as "can I have a beer please?"), are understood by the sheriff. All messages are case insensitive.

 - ```can I drink here?```
 - ```can I have a beer please?```
 - ```cowpoke me```
 - ```eat my ass```
 - ```howdy```
 - ```thank you for your service```
 - ```what the fuck```

### Accusation
```
@Sheriff <an offense>
```
The accusation mention has specific behavior that requires a more in depth description.

This is used in tandem with the `arrest` command. After a user has been put under arrest, the accuser, and *only* the accuser can then mention the sheriff and add an offense. The sheriff, if the offense is valid, will proceed to put the user in jail for the entirety of their sentence. If a user is further incarcerated for any offense that holds a longer sentence, that user's current sentence will be extended to the longer one.

## Timed Events
A number of events take place on a regular timer during the lifetime of the sheriff's active duty.

### Check Last Accusation
After a minute, if an accusation has not been given an offense, the sheriff will release the current suspect.

### Check Jail
The sheriff will regularly check each inmate's time spent in jail and will release them when they've served their sentence.

### Walking the Beat
Every two to three hours, if the chat has been active and it's not off hours (i.e. 12am to 8am), the sheriff will walk his beat. A variety of things can be checked in each instance, so one should be prepared for anything.

# Please have fun and enjoy!
